# Body Monitoring System
Our Body Monitoring System is capable of measuring human body temperature, heartbeat in PPM, and SPO2(Oxygen saturation) at a single time. We have used several sensors such as a temperature sensor, SPO2 sensor, etc.
This is very useful during the corona pandemic as anyone can check their health condition by himself from home. The system is designed with proteus, Arduino IDE and LabView.
